Smart Card

Idea:

I want to see what shows up when a smart card is scanned, how secure it is currently, and what issues there were with it in the past. My smart card reader that I bought isn't compatable with my chase smart card. So my presentation will be completely done in keynote

Objectives:

Understand some part of how Smart Cards operate, whether there are different algorithms used for different Smart Cards, and try to understand the faults in past iterations of Smart Cards.

Deliverables:

I am planning to show a presentation of the history of Smart Cards, as well as bringing up past issues with Smart cards and possibly discussing the solutions to these issues. Also showing the hardware behind the smart card itself.

Resources:

Hardware- Smart card reader, Smart card(technically hardware)

Software- Possibly Keynote, multiple ACS tools (Advanced Card Systems) used for scanning and reading information on smart cards
